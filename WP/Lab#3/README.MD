## Executed Tasks:
  - **Mandatory Tasks:**
 for Basic Level (grade 5 || 6) you should be able to:

Draw 5 lines of different colors and weights

Draw 2 Bezier curves

Draw 4 plane objects (ex. circle, square, pie, polygon...) of different colors, weights, filled and not

Draw 2 different objects using mouse

for Normal Level (grade 7 || 8) you should be able to:

Realize the tasks from Basic Level.

Draw a custom bitmap image

Fill 2 object with gradient

Hook keyboard input. Add 2 different keyboard combinations that will change mouse ability to draw objects (ex. on Ctrl+C will draw circles, on Alt+R will continue to draw circles but of read color)

Draw a Bezier curve using mouse

for Advanced Level (grade 9 || 10) you should be able to:

Realize the tasks from Normal Level.

Zoom in and out application working area using keyboard

Use mouse as an eraser (choose 1 option):

delete objects using mouse clicking

eraser of a fixed width

eraser with adjustable  width

for Bonus Point Tasks :

Realize the task with mouse eraser for all 3 cases listed above. In order to choose one of them, add 3 buttons/icons or check boxes.  
 


##  The application
  This is how I made this laboratory work. I started from reading about drawing lines and simple objects like       rectangle and ellipse from Petzold and Google. I implemented this. Then I delimited the region where I can draw and       where can not. Next step was Bezier and eraser. Bezier was easy to implement , cause we need 3 points in order to draw    it. So I stored data when Bezier tool is active and user click in the paint region, in array and when 3 times user click  we draw it.
Then i put the eraser.
Then I had to put all this things with data, like border, filling colors. I saw at someone that delimited the tools in 2 group boxes, so I thought that it will be a great idea if I will delimit it too because in this way is more user friendly. It took a lot of time with filling color, borders too.
Especially long, took to make the report :D.
